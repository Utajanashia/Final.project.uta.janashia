          Freddie Mercury, born Farrokh Bulsara on September 5, 1946, in
          Zanzibar, was the legendary frontman of Queen. Known for his powerful
          voice and dynamic stage presence, he became one of rock music’s most
          influential figures. After moving to England, Freddie formed Queen in
          1970 with Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon. His songwriting on
          hits like "Bohemian Rhapsody," "We Are the Champions," and "Somebody
          to Love" helped the band rise to global fame. His unique vocal range
          and ability to blend genres made Queen stand out, while his
          performances, especially at the 1985 Live Aid concert, became iconic.
          Freddie passed away on November 24, 1991, from AIDS-related
          complications, but his legacy lives on. Queen’s music remains
          timeless, and Freddie is remembered as a trailblazer who inspired
          generations of fans and artists.
