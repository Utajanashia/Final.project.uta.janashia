          <p class="smallcardtext">John Deacon was the last member to join Queen in 1971,
             completing the iconic lineup of Freddie Mercury, Brian May, and Roger Taylor.
              As the bass guitarist, he crafted memorable and intricate bass lines that defined 
              many of Queen's songs, such as "Another One Bites the Dust" and "Under Pressure."
               His musicality provided a strong rhythmic foundation.

          <p class="smallcardtext">Beyond his role as bassist, John Deacon was an accomplished 
            songwriter who contributed several of Queen’s biggest hits. He wrote "You're My Best Friend"
             as a tribute to his wife, Veronica, showcasing his talent for creating heartfelt lyrics and 
             catchy melodies. His most famous composition, "Another One Bites the Dust," became one of Queen's
              best-sellings.

          <p class="smallcardtext">: Known for being the most introverted member of Queen, 
            John Deacon often avoided the flamboyant stage antics that characterized his bandmates.
            He preferred to stay in the background, rarely giving interviews or seeking attention.
             His reserved demeanor earned him the nickname "the quiet one," but he was such an icon as bassist.

          <p class="smallcardtext">After Freddie Mercury's death in 1991, John Deacon 
            continued working with Queen for a few years but found it difficult to carry 
            on without Freddie. By the late 1990s, he retired from music entirely, choosing 
            to lead a private life away from the limelight. Unlike Brian May and Roger Taylor, 
            who continued to perform and keep Queen's legacy alive.

          <p class="cardtext"> John Deacon had a background in electronics, earning a degree in Electrical 
            Engineering from Chelsea College in London before joining Queen. This technical expertise 
             in handy for the band, as he often helped with equipment maintenance and sound innovations.
              His knowledge contributed to Queen’s experimental approach to music production, helping to
               create some of their unique sounds. For example, he designed and built the custom "Deacy Amp,"
                a small amplifier that played a key role in shaping the distinctive tone of his bass lines.
                 His engineering skills also helped the band with their complex studio setups, enabling them 
                 to explore new techniques in recording and sound design. Additionally, John was instrumental 
                 in designing some of the band’s unique stage equipment and lighting effects, helping Queen become
                  pioneers in live performance technology. His blend of musicality and technical know-how added a
                   distinct dimension to the band's creativity. Moreover, Deacon was known to be an early adopter 
                   of digital technologies in the studio, embracing synthesizers and other electronic instruments 
                   before they became commonplace in rock music.
