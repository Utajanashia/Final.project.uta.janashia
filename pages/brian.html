            Brian May formed Queen in 1970 with drummer Roger Taylor, bassist John Deacon,
             and lead vocalist Freddie Mercury. The band emerged from May and Taylor's 
             previous group, Smile, after Mercury joined and suggested the name "Queen."
              They quickly became known for their unique blend of rock, opera, and theatrical performances.

            Freddie Mercury and Brian May shared a close friendship
             and strong musical partnership. Despite their contrasting
              personalities, with Freddie being flamboyant and Brian more reserved, 
              they respected each other's talents. They co-wrote several of Queen's iconic 
              songs and supported each other throughout the band's rise.

        Brian May is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and astrophysicist,
        best known as the lead guitarist of the legendary rock band Queen. Born on 
        July 19, 1947, in Hampton, London, he grew up with a deep interest in both music 
        and science. May learned to play guitar at an early age, and his academic passion 
        led him to study physics and mathematics at Imperial College London. Although he began 
        a PhD in astrophysics, he left in 1971 to focus on his music career, eventually completing
        his doctorate in 2007, 36 years later. His thesis was on the Zodiacal Dust Cloud, showcasing 
        his commitment to science.
